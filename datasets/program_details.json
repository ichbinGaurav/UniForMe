        "Description/content": "The study programme is a fully-fledged computer science Master's programme that conveys specific expertise in key areas of computer science including theoretical foundations, practical skills and knowledge about application areas. This includes the areas of software engineering, information systems, databases, machine learning, communication and security, algorithms and programming.Students must select the study focus Visual Computing or Embedded Systems. As part of this study focus, embedded systems and visual computing students gain in-depth knowledge and can choose from a wide-ranging catalogue of modules. In addition, students acquire non-technical skills ranging from presentation techniques and team work to management and leadership skills.(1) Visual Computing Study FocusThe term visual computing comprises all computer science disciplines handling images and 3D models, i.e. computer vision, computer graphics, image processing, machine learning, visualisation and virtual and augmented reality. Visual computing systems deal with one or more of the following aspects: acquisition, processing and analysis of visual information, e.g. in the form of images and videos, but also originating from medical image acquisition technologies, and rendering of visual information, e.g. the generation of images from visual or other data. Application areas include but are not restricted to quality control, medical image processing and visualisation, autonomous robotics, multimedia systems, film and television industries and computer games.(2) Embedded Systems Study FocusThe variety and number of embedded systems have grown significantly during the last years. This segment has become by far the most important one in the computer market with applications such as consumer electronics, industrial control and transportation systems. Transportation systems such as automotive electronics are of particular interest, because of stringent timing and dependability requirements that act as technology catalysts. The embedded systems market is expected to grow significantly over the next decade, and it is expected that many embedded systems will be connected to the Internet and form cyber-physical systems.In both study foci, students benefit from the close collaboration between electrical engineering and computer science and a tight link to research projects conducted in both disciplines at the University of Siegen. For embedded systems, both disciplines contribute to courses on the specific knowledge including key areas such as hardware/software design, computer architectures, real-time systems, dependability, security, operating systems, modelling and application areas (e.g. automotive, industrial control). In the context of visual computing, the tight link to sensor development is an essential added value, including key areas like face detection, online range data processing with range cameras such as the Kinect, and multimodal pattern recognition.The University of Siegen participates and leads research projects in healthcare, automotive, industrial control, avionics and home automation. Master's students are welcome to become involved in these projects (e.g. Master's thesis, student projects), and excellent students get the opportunity to pursue a PhD in one of these projects in Siegen.",
        "Course Organisation": "The Master's programme Computer Science at the University of Siegen includes different types of modules.Core modules convey a broad spectrum of relevant topics for computer science including theoretical, practical and technical computer science. Practical modules convey basic practical skills such as capabilities in software and hardware development as well as practical activities that are close to future occupational areas. The practical modules establish key qualifications that are required for team work in typical projects of the information technology industry.Specialised modules convey profound scientific knowledge in the area of embedded systems or visual computing. Specialised modules can be chosen out of a comprehensive catalogue of modules. The specialised modules build on top of the core modules and focus on expertise in an area that is typically the foundation for the student projects and the Master's thesis.The programme is structured as follows:1. Four out of six core modules (6 CP each): Embedded Systems, Computer Architecture, Modelling and Animation, Parallel Processing, Algorithms, Advanced Logic2. Practical and research oriented modules: Cutting Edge Research (6 CP), Scientific Working (including seminar, 9 CP), project work (15 CP)3. Six specialised modules (6 CP each)4. Master's thesis (30 CP)For the study focus embedded systems, specialised modules are offered in several areas such as networked embedded systems, microelectronics, semiconductor technology, artificial intelligence, ubiquitous systems and real-time systems. Courses for networked embedded systems encompass modules about communication engineering and telematics. Students can also explore the development of embedded systems using FPGAs and state-of-the-art Systems-on-a-Chip (SoC). Another highlight of the programme includes courses in the area of small embedded computing units as part of ubiquitous systems that are equipped with basic processing and sensing modules, thus enabling them to detect, monitor, react on, and learn phenomena around them. Furthermore, knowledge in the area of artificial intelligence and deep learning will be conveyed, which can be deployed in embedded systems as part of student projects and Master's theses.The specialisation areas within the study focus visual computing are computer vision, computer graphics and machine learning. While these three sub-topics are highly interlinked, the Master's degree offers specific courses related to them. As these are advanced courses, students are expected to already have some basic knowledge related to image processing, computer graphics, and/or machine learning from their Bachelor's studies. Computer vision involves theoretical and algorithmic approaches to autonomously understand image and video data, presented in courses such as machine vision and convex optimisation. Computer graphics comprises methods for the generation of images from digital representations, including the generation and simulation of and the interaction with virtual environments, studied in courses like rendering, GPU programming, scientific visualisation and virtual reality. Machine learning deals with methods to train computers to perform a specific task on the basis of sample solutions. Statistic learning theory, deep learning, and recent advances in machine learning are related courses."

On the basis of a broad understanding of the subject area with select areas of emphasis, creative and constructive abilities to produce and develop hardware and software systems are nurtured and honed. In addition, the students’ basic research and applied research skills in the field of computer science are developed and enhanced.Career ProspectsBuilding on one’s initial career-qualifying degree, this Master’s programme provides knowledge and competencies that enable graduates to pursue doctoral research – e.g. in a doctoral programme – or to engage in complex industrial or freelance activities in the areas of research, development, implementation, distribution, or maintenance. Typical areas of activity for computer scientists with a Master’s degree are the development of new methods and systems for information processing (e.g. for manufacturing corporations, software companies, and research institutions), the introduction of automated information processing systems in companies or administrative departments, and activities relating to operations, as well as product maintenance and distribution in the computer industry. Computer scientists are also qualified to work at a range of academic institutes, including research and teaching activities at universities.Click here for detailed information about the course of study.",
        "Course Organisation": "The structure of the Master's programme is based on the current recommendations of the German Informatics Society (GI). It is divided into four sections: Computer Science, Projects, Language and Master's Thesis (see table).In the first year, basic and extended competences in theoretical elements of study are taught. After that, one semester with a focus on practical study elements follows. The final semester is devoted to the Master thesis.The third semester is completely designed as a project semester and represents an essential characteristic of the Master's degree programme. After deepening their education in the first year, this project semester enables the students to apply their acquired skills to practical situations. Normally, a project is realised at the University of Bayreuth under intensive and individual supervision from scientists and tutors within the framework of a relevant research project.A project has 8 or 15 credit points (small or large project) and includes a practical part (for example, practical training) and a theoretical part (for example, seminar). Students can choose how they want to divide the project semester, for example, two large projects or one large and two small projects. Since students have to complete more than one project, a fixation on just one application area can be avoided. One of the selected projects should lay the groundwork for the Master's thesis, thus allowing an easy transition to the third phase of study. The chosen projects can either be interdisciplinary or exclusively related to computer science. This is also true for the Master's thesis.It is possible for German students to spend the second semester as a semester abroad at an English-speaking university.

These encompass interface design, user-centred design, usability engineering, qualitative empirical methods, and the integration of organisational and technology development processes, all of which constitute the core elements of the HCI Master's programme. The research-focused programme curriculum includes mandatory lectures, research seminars, three practical projects, a voluntary internship, and a Master’s thesis.Anyone looking for successful socio-technical systems (i.e. humans and machines) will discover that good, long-term interactive design geared to humans is essential. The key to the hands-on HCI Master's programme in Siegen is to provide students with a solid, broad grounding in methods and techniques. This is the basis for well-founded conception, design, and implementation as well as for testing IT systems for humans.Classic usability often centres on (quantitative) lab studies. In Siegen, we are convinced this is simply not enough because it reduces human involvement to a minimum. This is the reason why our work is particularly embedded in the qualitative ethnographic field, i.e. directly in user practice. One main focus is on the involvement of users when designing systems. We refer to this as Grounded Design.In Siegen, research and teaching go hand in hand. The research is embedded in projects in the departments of Business Information Systems and New Media, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, IT for the Ageing Society, Cyber-Physical Systems, Experience & Interaction, and IT Security & Consumer Informatics. Students often work directly on research projects that are commonly conducted in partnership with industry. Not only does this signify high research relevance and the possibility of genuine scientific work but it also provides a very close link to practice.We have international teaching and research partnerships all over the world. For an overview of exchange opportunities, see:https://hci-siegen.de/current-projects-jobs/.Our alumni typically work in research, UX or UI design, consulting, development, management, and other areas.",

Many companies already recognise the enormous value that the use of data can have for product development, production, marketing, customer relationship management and ultimately sales. Therefore, when dealing with these large amounts of data, the focus is not only on statistical evaluation and information technology preparation but also on the targeted utilisation of the data collected for communication and marketing purposes. Data scientists therefore need additional competencies that enable them to strategically analyse the problems from an ethical, legal and business perspective and to implement them in a targeted manner in the company due to their pronounced communication skills.Data science generates a new interdisciplinary professional field. To meet these requirements, special skills are required that go beyond the know-how of a single discipline. The necessary knowledge to be acquired is made up of knowledge and skills from various areas of science. The new part-time, interdisciplinary and international Master's degree course of study in Data Science, which is part of Department 4 (Economics), fills this gap and provides in-depth training in the relevant disciplines.

        "Description/content": "In many companies with overseas branches, partners and customers, software development has a global dimension. It is no longer uncommon to find a development team dispersed across countries or continents. On one hand, this poses a special challenge for development methodologies and processes, on the other hand, it demands intercultural competencies of all team members.Besides state-of-the-art technologies and frameworks of current fields such as parallel programming and web/mobile applications, this three- to four-semester Master's programme focuses on development methodologies and their application in intercultural teams. It has a very practical orientation and is taught entirely in English.Therefore, optional German language courses are offered by our language centre.Applicants planning to live and work in Germany after graduation will need a deeper knowledge of the German language and culture.

        "Description/content": "We are witnessing rapid changes in the industrial environment, mainly driven by business and societal needs towards production customisation and the digitalisation of the economy. In 2006, the term Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) was coined to refer to the integration of computation with physical processes. CPS can be described as smart systems that encompass hardware and software as well as computational and physical components. These are seamlessly integrated, closely interacting to sense and to control the changing state of the real world in real time. These systems involve a high degree of complexity at numerous spatial and temporal scales, and highly networked communications integrating their computational and physical components. As such, CPS refers to Information-Communication-Control-Mechatronics Systems (sensing, actuating, computing, communicating, etc.) embedded in physical objects, interconnected through several networks including the internet, and providing citizens and businesses with a wide range of innovative applications based on digitalised data, information, and services.Ontologically, the term Cyber-Physical Systems means hardware-software systems that tightly couple the physical world and the digitalised (virtual) world. In a CPS ecosystem, on the one hand every real physical object (things/assets) has one or more cyber representations, and on the other hand a cyber component or system can be linked to a physical representation, i.e. an object in the three-dimensional human-tangible world. Moreover, these things are increasingly interconnected in real-operational time, either permanently networked or communicating in an asynchronous manner from time to time, using the Internet (Internet-of-Things, IoT). Digitalised data and information associated to functions of these things are then exposed as services in the Internet (Internet-of-Service, IoS) and they can be consumed by any other CPS for performing business.Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS) forge the core of real-world networked industrial infrastructures that have a cyber representation through digitalisation of data and information across the enterprise, along the product and process engineering life cycle, and from suppliers to customers along the supply chain. As such, the competitive performance of an ICPS mainly depends on the ability to effectively collect, analyse, and use large-scale digitalised data and information from many different and often heterogeneous sources in order to sustainably and efficiently manage, supervise, and operate in the industrial environments. This effective information-driven interaction of ICPS with other real-time critical CPS like IT-enterprise systems, extending to all business processes, is viewed as vital to modern industries.There are many challenges ahead in the convergence of computing, control, mechatronics, communications and software programming for CPS ecosystems. There is a need for investigating and learning a wide spectrum of foundations, research, and technological fields. In this context, the Master's in Industrial Informatics with a specialisation in ICPS addresses the penetration and proliferation of such ecosystems in the industrial environments, taking into account that the same trend is also evident in other domains such as energy, healthcare, manufacturing, military, transportation, consumer, enterprise, robotics, and smart cities, among others.",

        "Description/content": "To mitigate climate change is a matter of urgency, and thus, the energy transition represents one of the greatest technological and societal challenges of our time. The main challenge for a reliable, economically and ecologically feasible energy supply lies in the efficient, secure and reliable digitalisation of a technical system that integrates a huge, fluctuating, and difficult-to-forecast number of energy generators, consumers, storage facilities and grid components into a technically stable and financially viable overall system. In addition, the energy system is a critical infrastructure – the lifeline of modern societies. The failure or impairment of such a system would result in long lasting supply bottlenecks, significant disruptions to public safety or other dramatic effects.This degree programme enables graduates to conduct research at research institutions or universities on the still missing elements of a successful digitalisation in the energy domain and thus on the implementation of the energy transition; or to occupy diverse positions in the energy industry due to the high practical relevance of the study content.The Master's programme consists of a compulsory part, which teaches core competences in the field of designing and engineering of cyber-physical energy systems. These competences reflect the diversity of energy informatics systems and their fields of application and, together with various thematic specialisation options, allow for a meaningful deepening and specialisation with respect to individual interests. Different domain-specific application perspectives are taught independently so that students acquire broad application knowledge that goes beyond the specific energy system class. Societal and socio-technical issues are also represented as a cross-sectional topic.The courses cover the following topics and more:Smart gridsRenewable energy(Distributed) Artificial intelligenceCo-simulationDesign and assessment of experimentsControl theoryCritical engineeringEnergy marketsRequirements engineeringModelling and controlCyber-resilienceIn a cross-group research project, which addresses control at the component level, communication, and also the use of agents in the context of optimisation in energy systems, the learned contents are consolidated and tested in practice.",

Students will attend lectures, seminars, and project lab courses under the supervision of scientists who introduce them to basic and applied research and current topics in machine learning.To pick up on scientific trends and make the best use of the current state of research, the curriculum relies heavily on the strong research presence on site in machine learning (Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, Excellence Cluster \"Machine Learning: New Perspectives for Science'',  Tübingen AI Center, Cyber Valley, IMPRS for Intelligent Systems) as well as in the wider field of computer science. Top-level researchers in all major methodological branches of machine learning are present in Tübingen – personnel that will actively engage in teaching the Master’s programme in Machine Learning. (SeeCSRankingsfor the University of Tübingen and note that the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems is located in Tübingen as well.) Since the field is obviously very young and currently developing extremely rapidly, training will naturally be based on the most recent insights and the most pressing research questions of these teaching researchers. Project work and the Master’s thesis will offer students the opportunity to develop code for research purposes and their own scientific projects.As interdisciplinarity is an important aspect, the Master’s thesis can be supervised by a professor of any subfield of computer science.",

        "Description/content": "The Master's programme in geospatial technologies is aimed at holders of Bachelor's degrees in application areas of geographic information such as environmental sciences, geosciences, ecology, regional planning, computer science.Geospatial technologies is an innovative professional area that bridges the gap between informatics and geosciences. Graduates of the international Master's programme apply and develop methods for computer-supported solutions for spatially related problems (global, regional, local). Therefore, graduates receive the following specialised knowledge in:Geospatial technologies and geographic informationInformatics and mathematicsYou can find some impressions from students here:https://mastergeotech.uji.es/about-us/testimonials/.",
        "Course Organisation": "The programme consists of three semesters (90 ECTS credit points), including two semesters of courses (30 ECTS credit points each) and the Master's thesis in the third semester (30 ECTS credit points).The Master's programme will be held with up to 32 students. Half of them attend their first semester at the University Jaume I (UJI), half at the New University of Lisbon (UNL). UJI and UNL offer courses with a different focus in order to address the different backgrounds and requirements of the incoming students. Both partners offer basic modules in geographic information (GI), although with different intensity. The programme at UJI stresses the computing aspects of GI, such as computer graphics and web services, whereas the programme at UNL is more oriented towards the processing and modelling aspects of geographic information, including topics such as remote sensing and geospatial data mining. As for the other modules, UJI is more informatics-oriented (informatics, mathematics and new technologies modules). UNL provides modules in mathematics, statistics and data modelling. UNL offers different paths within its modules through alternative courses so, for example, a student with a background in social sciences, such as geography, and little previous know-how in informatics should choose descriptive statistics and data analysis, whereas a more informatics-related student should choose mathematic statistics and data mining.For the second semester, all students attend the courses at the University of Münster (WWU). The first module conveys fundamentals in GI science. The second module, Advanced Topics in GI Science, delivers knowledge on ongoing research and research projects, thus preparing the students for their own research in the Master's thesis. Optional courses on this module can be replaced by an annual summer school conducted at WWU, UJI, or UNL, or by work in ongoing research projects in one of the partners' research groups. The third module covers additional core competencies, which students will need for their Master's thesis as well as for their future professional careers: research methods in GI science and project management in GI projects.In the third semester (Master's thesis), students can choose one of the three universities, wherein the applicants will be distributed equally to the three partners. If a student has not attended courses at one of the three partner universities, one of the supervisors or co-supervisors has to be from that university. With the Master's thesis, the candidate shows that they are capable of independently handling a defined scientific problem within a defined schedule, and in a way that is ready to publish. Typically, the Master's thesis will be integrated into an ongoing research project at one of the partner universities.A joint degree is awarded by the University of Münster, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Portugal, and Universitat Jaume I, Castellon, Spain.PDF Download"
