The course content is tailor-made for students who want to take their IT expertise to a new level.Students can choose from six different tracks. This\\xa0track structure allows our students to discover the diversity of computer science while specialising in the area that excites them the most. The tracks are based on our interdisciplinary research clusters:Algorithms and FoundationsData and AIDigital HealthSecurity EngineeringSystemsIn the \"Open Track\", modules from all areas can be taken, so that Computer Science can also be studied without specialisation.In addition, special emphasis is placed on improving methodological skills at the research level. Through compulsory modules such as \"Research Methods & Ethics\" and \"Critical Reading & Discussion,\" students learn to understand and implement ethical problems in the context of scientific activities.Students at the Hasso Plattner Institute are also challenged and supported personally. Our curriculum integrates elective modules from the area of professional skills, which include courses in design thinking, entrepreneurship, and management.Graduates are equipped with comprehensive IT expertise in technical and interdisciplinary skills.'"
